                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>
                    Deep Jyoti Refactories is a focused manufacturer of refractory mortars and castables, based in
                    Gujarat – the heart of India’s ceramic and refractory ecosystem. We exist to support industries
                    where heat, pressure and consistency are non-negotiable.

                <h3>What We Believe</h3>
                <p>
                    Refractories are not commodities. Every furnace, kiln and boiler behaves differently. We believe
                    material formulation, raw material selection and process control make the real difference between
                    failure and long service life.

                <h3>Our Manufacturing Focus</h3>
                <p>
                    Our mortars and castables are formulated for strength, workability and thermal stability. Each batch
                    is produced with strict quality checks to ensure consistency that installers and maintenance teams
                    can rely on.
